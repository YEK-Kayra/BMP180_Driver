# BMP180_Driver
 It contains driver files and application for STM32 users. It support I2C interface in communication

# Sensor Overview
The BMP180 is the function compatible successor of the BMP085, a new generation of high
precision digital pressure sensors for consumer applications.
The ultra-low power, low voltage electronics of the BMP180 is optimized for use in mobile phones,
PDAs, GPS navigation devices and outdoor equipment. With a low altitude noise of merely 0.25m at
fast conversion time, the BMP180 offers superior performance. The I2C interface allows for easy
system integration with a microcontroller.
